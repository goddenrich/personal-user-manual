Optional Section: You may want to fill out this as a section to help introduce yourself to new joiners or to people from outside your team. Feel free to keep it light and don't worry about going into much detail about yourself in a professional sense, as that can be covered by later sections. Some suggested points might be where you grew up, what your hobbies are or a fun fact about yourself.

## How to Contact Me


I prefer to be contacted via slack for short interactions or in person or video call for longer discussions. I hardly ever read or respond to emails.

## Preferred Working Style


I like to deeply focus on one thing. It doesn't take me long to concentrate when in the right mood but can find myself getting distracted if I'm not in a concentrating mood. I work better later on in the day. I respond strongly to deadlines especially if it's a task I don't particularly enjoy like writing (non-code).

## What Motivates Me


I am motivated by being an expert on some aspect. I generally like being the person people come to if they want the answer to some problem. I equally like the highlevel system/process design work and low level programming. 

## What Demotivates Me


Having to write up things. Project managment.

## My Values (and what I value in others)


I am highly principaled and generally form strong oppinions. I am motivated by healthy and respectful debate and like to be challenged with my assumptions and opinions. I value directness and explicit rather than implicit communication. I admire logic and tend to value whether something makes sense rather than the emotions of a decision.

## My Blind Spots


I can often come across as quite dismissive. I often do not intend this and it is probably a result of valuing directness. I assume others will voice an equally strong oppinion if they disagree strongly.

## My Pet Peeves


Someone giving up on a debate without coming to some sort of mutual understanding despite disagreement. Having to chase things.
